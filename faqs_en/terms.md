•	Discussions on specific data sets;
•	Share of enriched or modified data sets;

Consult and download open data
To consult and download the data available at dados.gov, you do not need any type of enrolment or prior registry.

Registry at dados.gov and access to specific functions
Any individual or legal person, public or private, may contribute to dados.gov, publishing data sets, reuses, contents, resources and comments regarding the data sets.
For this purpose, the user must sign in/log in at dados.gov. This registry belongs to an individual user and not to an organization or legal person.
By signing in, the user creates a profile at dados.gov. For more details, consult the point regarding “Data protection”.
After validating the registry, several functions become available.
The participant may access “community” functions, such as:
•	Create or associate an organization;
•	Publish a data set, as a downloadable file, link or API;
•	Publish additional resources associated to a data set published by other participant (i.e. a data set to which columns regarding geographical information were added);
•	Publish a reuse, either as a web link or with a presentation format;
•	Initiate discussions and publish comments to signal problems or make suggestions, for instance.
The participant is also able to share and integrate contents in other websites and may also contribute for the maintenance of quality of dados.gov, for instance by signalling contents which are not compliant with the TCU.
Functions related to organizations
The participants may create or be registered in organizations, which may be formal or informal. The organizations are created and managed at dados.gov by one, or more, administrator(s).
The organizations may:
•	Publish data sets;
•	Publish additional resources;
•	Publish reuses;
They cannot comment or participate in discussions – only individual participants may do so.

AMA suggests two types of certifications regarding organizations:
•	Certification of Public Services: identifies the public bodies;
•	Certificate of the Organization’s Authenticity: certifies the validity of the accounts associated to companies, non-governmental organizations or others.
For certification requests, send an email to: dados@ama.pt.

The certificate ensures, to the users, that the data provided was uploaded by a participant of the correspondent body. It also allows the certificated organizations’ data to achieve better results on the search engine.
In the case of non-compliance with these terms and conditions of use, AMA reserves the possibility of revoking the certifications assigned to entities.
