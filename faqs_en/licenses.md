# Licenses

**Note: the [Terms and Conditions of the website can be found on another portal section](https://dados.gov.pt/pt/docs/terms/).**

The reuse license is one of the essential conditions to provide and publish open data. It is the license which stipulates the possibility to reuse the data for several purposes, including the commercial reuse.

The license which is used by default at [dados.gov is the CC BY 4.0 (Creative Commons Attribution 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode "CC BY 4.0"), which implies the mention of the data original source but allows any type of use.

However, it is also possible to upload data with other open licenses, such as the [CCZero (Creative Commons CC0 1.0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode "CCZero"). In exceptional cases, and when the public interest so justifies, data may be entered with restrictive licenses.
