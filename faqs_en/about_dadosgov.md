# About dados.gov

Dados.gov is the **Portuguese Public Administration’s open data portal**.

Its function is to aggregate, reference and store open data from different Public Administration’s bodies and sectors, therefore creating the **central catalogue of open data in Portugal**. Besides working as a shared data storing and publication service, it may be used by any public body, also working as an indexing portal of contents in other open data portals/catalogues, either sectorial (e.g. Health, Justice, Environment) or local (e.g. City Council of Lisbon, City Council of Águeda).

Dados.gov also promotes cases of reuse which use public shared data and provide various information on the open data movement, publication and reuse, among others.

**Dados.gov is an open portal**, which means that any user, on their behalf or representing an organization, may create an account and load data, so they are shared with the community, under open licenses.

It also provides several interaction mechanisms between data suppliers and re-users, such as the possibility to commend, submit complementary data versions and suggest improvements to the platform.

It is developed and managed by the Agência para a Modernização Administrativa, IP (AMA) and is based on the [udata platform](https://udata.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ "udata"), a product created by Etalab, a structure of the French Public Administration’s mission, which is developed and made available as open source.
